# AutoML-Coder

*. Developed an AI-powered tool that automates machine learning code generation, simplifying dataset preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.
*. Technologies Used: SmolAgents (task automation), Gradio (user interface), Gemini 1.5 Flash (AI engine for code generation).
*. Key Features: Automates dataset handling, model selection, and optimization. Uses Agentic AI to intelligently generate and refine machine learning code. Offers a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
*. Role and Contributions: Designed and built the automation pipeline for code generation. Integrated the Gemini 1.5 Flash AI engine to optimize code output. Created the Gradio-based interface for user accessibility.
*. Impact: Cut code generation time by 50% and boosted model accuracy by 10% in initial tests.
